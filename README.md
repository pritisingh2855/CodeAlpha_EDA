## ðŸŽ¯ 1. Objective of the Task

The objective of this project was to analyze the Indian Census dataset at the state and district levels.  
Key demographic indicators such as **literacy**, **sex ratio**, **population density**, and **urban share** were explored to understand spatial and social variations across states.
